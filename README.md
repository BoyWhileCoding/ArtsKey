By Entering 'GUI', a new window pops up

![gui_b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89507875/176729674-4ce83bc8-a7e4-4798-8510-e6ea42230120.png)

This is a custom tabbed window.
Now as you can there is a big black rectangle, followed by some text and buttons.

Now, we type 'example' in the 'Path to Image' entry as directed in the status box and click 'Select'. A notification comes saying

![gui_c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89507875/176730858-56070640-e267-4fc8-9195-62c9b81b1d4e.png)

Now, we click 'Ok' followed by 'Done'.

![gui_d](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89507875/176732479-c023a4ca-a423-4476-96e6-cb7f1e74f7c1.png)

This time a photo pops up into the black box, which is the example image, and the Image Path entry changes to {The path to ArtsKey.exe}/files/example_input.png which is generated by the program.
As the default Image Clearance Level is already set to 2, we'll leave it as it is and click 'Generate'.

![gui_e](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89507875/176733321-902d5243-23ba-49a7-9a2e-f94f029861bc.png)

After a few moments the Image Path entry is empty and the statusbox says 'Done', which depicts that the Conversion is sucessful

Now, we open {The path to ArtsKey.exe}/files/results/, there is a new file named 'example_ascii_art_level_2.png'
